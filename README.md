# ForeCastingLab
ForecastLab is a local web app for time series forecasting and 'what if' analysis. Upload a sales (or sensor) CSV, run baseline forecasts with prediction intervals and backtests, then apply scenario events (ex. promo uplift or stockout shock) to compare baseline vs counterfactual forecasts in the browser.
